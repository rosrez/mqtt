OPTIONS EXPLAINED:

-p 8883
        Broker port to connect to. 8883 is used for TLS-encrypted communication.

--cafile ~/certs/mqtt/ca.crt
        The (root) CA authority certificate the client is told to trust. The file is in (PEM) format, but
        if the alternative --capath option is used, it expects the *.crt extensions of certificate files.

-h (--host)
        host to connect to. This parameter is matched against the Common Name of the certificate the
        server presents. So, for example, if we omit this parameter, mosquitto clients will use "localhost"
        by default. localhost doesn't match the (DNS, hosts) name we used to connect to the broker so
        the underlying TLS implementation (OpenSSL) rejects it.

        NOTE: It is strongly advised to use the subjAltName field where you can place multiple different
        names for the same host. In the case above, that could be: localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.6 (local IP
        of the NIC).
